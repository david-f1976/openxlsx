This [R](https://www.R-project.org/) package simplifies the creation of `.xlsx` files by providing a high level interface to writing, styling and editing worksheets. Through the use of [`Rcpp`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rcpp), read/write times are comparable to the [`xlsx`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=xlsx) and [`XLConnect`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=XLConnect) packages with the added benefit of removing the dependency on Java.
